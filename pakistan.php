      <div style="margin-right: 10px; margin-left: 20px;"> <p>Tourism being relatively uncommon, people were openly curious about our presence. One of my fellow travelers proved particularly popular regarding photo requests; it turned out he resembles various mustachioed Australian cricketers (Merv Hughes, Travis Head, a substantially taller David Boon).

        Cricket is wildly popular in Pakistan and played everywhere, from the city streets to the mountain valleys. Imran Khan, the captain of the 1992 World Cup-winning team, became Prime Minister and maintained strong grassroots support after being imprisoned on questionable grounds. (“Talking about politics is a national pastime,” said Aneeqa Ali, founder of Pakistani travel company The Mad Hatters, who I met in Islamabad. But religion, she added, is more taboo.)<br>
        Islamabad lies at the foot of the Margalla Hills National Park, a refuge for city dwellers escaping the heat (and a population of leopards). One morning - painfully early - I joined a local trail running group, gasped, and wheezed my way up switchback paths carpeted in pine needles to a summit overlooking the city. I could hear the distant rush of traffic far below, layered under birdsong. We jogged along the ridge line and back down to the carpark - a warmup for the trip's main event.

        Pakistan has abundant hiking and mountaineering opportunities, especially in its Himalaya-adjacent Karakoram range, which includes some of the world’s highest peaks and valleys of staggering beauty. Yet, the tourism figures don’t reflect this.In 2019, around 28,000 foreigners visited Pakistan on tourism visas, compared to 1.2 million tourist arrivals in Nepal and nearly 11 million in India.
